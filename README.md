# Deepface01

About Deepface 
Deepface is a facial recognition and attributes analysis framework for python created by the artificial intelligence research group at Facebook in 2015. 
Keras and Tensorflow inspire this library’s core components. It is a hybrid face recognition framework that uses state-of-the-art models for analysis such as VGG-Face,
Google Facenet, Facebook Deepface, all wrapped together in one. 
Deepface’s face identifying accuracy goes up to 97% and has proved to be more successful in detecting faces than the average face recognition frameworks. 
Facebook uses Deepface to prevent impersonation and identity theft on its platform. 

Getting Started with Facial Recognition Model
We will try to create a face detection and facial feature recognition model using Facebook’s Deepface Framework to identify and distinguish between a set of images. 
We will also compare the results using two of many in-house models present in the framework and predict the age of the faces present in the images. 

Creating The Model
We will first install the Deepface Library to help us call our further modules to use. It can be done by running the following command :

!pip install deepface #install the Deepface Library
